 This code plays the game of Bingo in a Monte Carlo setting,
 averaging N simulated games of Bingo for a specified number of bingo
 boards.

 It tries to answer the following questions:
 1. What is the expected number of draws to win regular bingo if there are
     N bingo boards in play?
 2. What is the convergence rate of expected number of draws vs. number of
     bingo boards for a certain number of simulated bingo games?
 3. What about inner square, outer square, and cover all?
